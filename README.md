# Semantic-Textual-Similarity
Helps to find semantic similarity between sentences
- I utilise a Python module called streamlit to create and deploy Machine Learning models.
- First, I made a streamlit page by importing the streamlit library.
-	Second, I developed a function that accepts two parameters, text1 and text2, and returns normalised similarity scores.
-	Finally, I constructed a streamlit form with two text fields and one submit button that displays the normalised similarity score. The generated application was then deployed to the Streamlit cloud.
- Similarity score --> 0 means Highly dissimilar, 0.5 means dissimilar, 1 means Highly similar
-	Deployed app link - <Under deployment>
